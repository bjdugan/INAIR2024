## Overview

> This report includes artificial or aggregate data and is intended for demonstration purposes only.

*HIPs in Practice* is a targeted data collection focused on students participating in specific HIPs. During the Spring of 2021, 15 institutions participated in this effort focusing on two HIPs: learning communities and culminating experiences (capstone course, senior project, etc.). The survey includes a series of questions specific to each HIP, engagement-related questions drawn from NSSE, and items adapted from NSSEâ€™s [module](https://nsse.indiana.edu/nsse/survey-instruments/topical-modules/inclusiveness.html) on Inclusiveness and Engagement with Cultural Diversity to examine issues of equity. 

This report presents students responses to the *HIPs in Practice* survey administered during the late spring of 2021. `r overview_n` students in `r overview_prog_msg` at
`r  ifelse(params$unitid != 888888, params$inst_name, "15 institutions")` responded to this questionnaire, for an overall response rate of `r round(overview_overall_rr, 1)`%. The following tables detail `r ifelse(params$unitid != 888888, "your", "")` students' responses, by program.

Kuh and O'Donnell[^1] identified eight key elements that make these activities high-impact:  

* Performance expectations set at appropriately high levels  
* Significant investment of time and effort by students over an extended period of time  
* Interactions with faculty and peers about substantive matters  
* Frequent, timely, and constructive feedback  
* Experiences with diversity wherein students are exposed to and must contend with unfamiliar people and circumstances  
* Periodic, structured opportunities to reflect and integrate learning  
* Opportunities to discover relevance of learning through real-world applications  
* Public demonstration of competence.  

This report is structured around these facets of engagement, with an added emphasis on diversity and equity. Responses are presented by theme.

Students participating in learning communities and culminating senior experiences received slightly different surveys with some items tailored to those experiences. These items are presented in their respective sections below; common items are presented by theme. 

Percentages may not sum to 100 due to rounding, and should be interpreted with appropriate caution where cell counts or program level response rates are low. To maximize available data and protect confidentiality, programs were collapsed where respondent counts number less than five, and not reported if that category ("All others") itself was less than five.

## Student Feedback
Near the conclusion of the survey, students were asked to share what had been the most (`hip21_22`) and least (`hip21_23`) satisfying about their experience. Altogether, students provided 
`r format(comment_counts[[1, "n_min"]], big.mark = ",")`
responses about the most satisfying aspects of their experience, and 
`r format(comment_counts[[2, "n_min"]], big.mark = ",")`
responses about the least satisfying. Student responses can be found in your data file, and have not been edited for language or quality.
