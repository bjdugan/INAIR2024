## Abstract
There are more options at our disposal to build reports now than ever, but many remain time consuming and labor-intensive. R Markdown provides a flexible interface to blend summarized data, visualizations, and prose into a variety of formats (Word, PDF, HTML), but requires a fair amount of R expertise and effort at the outset. This session relates insights and techniques employed in the development of reports for two similar surveys administered to students at several dozen institutions a year apart, reflecting on advanced approaches to programming that reduce the need for tedious aspects of report development. Specifically, this session will highlight the adoption of techniques in the statistical programming language R and Markdown in the second iteration of survey reporting that simplified and standardized aspects of the process with the aim of demonstrating both particular code and methods as well as more general programming approaches that apply to other situations.
